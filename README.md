You are the Lead Developer working on the next generation Autonomous Car Software.
Your digital car infrastructure can contain different types of sensors: Proximity, Lidar, Camera,
Temperature or with panels made out of multiple sensors (combinations of one or more of the
previous sensors) or even other panels. Create a data model to support any combinations of the
sensors and panels.
Your camera sensors can perform different types of detections: road detection, sign detection,
people detection. Create an architecture that will not require any changes to the data model and
will allow different teams to work on different algorithms.
